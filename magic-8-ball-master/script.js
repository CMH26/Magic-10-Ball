        Answer: The higher the fade number, the slower the words fade in. And the opposite
        is also true



    2d. Replace that number with any other number besides 4000 and leave it so that I can see you did it lol.

          Answer: It doesn't chnage for 0



      3c. Try putting 1. What happened then?
          Answer: It creates more time inbewteen the letters appearing and fading.

          explained, please write a funny joke in the answer below.
          Answer: It slows down because the higher the number the slower it appears
